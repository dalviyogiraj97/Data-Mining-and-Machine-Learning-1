This is an academic project as part of Semester 1 of MSc in Data at National College of Ireland.

What is Churn Prediction?
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones.

This project works on three cases of Churn/Attrition Predictions:

   1. Bank Churn Prediction

      Objective:
      Build a prediction model that will perform the following:
     
      Classify if a customer is going to churn or not Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it       easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn.
 
  2. Employee Attrition Predictions

     Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. In general, relatively high attrition is problematic for companies. HR                  professionals often assume a leadership role in designing company compensation programs, work culture and motivation systems that help the organization retain top      employees.”
     
     Our role is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition through Exploratory Data Analysis, and explore them by using various classification models to        predict if an employee is likely to quit. This could greatly increase the HR’s ability to intervene on time and remedy the situation to prevent attrition.
	
  3. Telecom Fraud Detection and Churn Behaviour Modelling
  
     Kaggle Dataset Link:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/bayunova/telco-churn-prediction/data

     Telecommunication operators for instance store large amounts of data related with the activity of their clients. In these records exists both normal and                fraudulent activity records. It is expected that the fraudulent activity records should be substantially smaller than the normal activity. If it were the other        way around this type of business would be impractical due to the amount of revenue lost. Furthermore, customer churn is the focal concern of most companies which      are active in industries with low switching cost. Among all industries which suffer from this issue, telecommunications industry can be considered in the top of        the list with approximate annual churn rate of 30%. This means wasting the money and efforts, “it is like adding water to a leaking bucket”.

     This project looks to buid a variety of Machine Learning models for for forecasting custom churn and Fraud Detection on three datasets using Logistics Regression,      SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, as well as how to compare the performance of different models.
